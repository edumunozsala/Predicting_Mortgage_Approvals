# Predicting_Mortgage_Approvals
Capstone for MS Program in Data Science

This repository contains many of the notebooks developed to analyze a dataset of mortgage approvals. This exercise is the final capstone in the Microsoft Professional Program in Data Science and the report included is the result of this analysis. Then as part of the capstone I developed a machine learning model to classify when a mortgage application would be accepted or not by the loan company. The Ml model was developed using the Microsoft tool, Azure Machine Learning Studio.

I have all included some Jupyter notebooks used to built some basic classfication model based in decision trees. But they are not intended to be the best classifier, they are just some simple excercises in building a classifier using the Sci-Kit Learn lybrary on Python.

Some of the notebooks are under construction and maybe some new model will be included in the future.
